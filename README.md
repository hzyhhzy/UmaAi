### What is needed?
#### 1.Analyzing scenario mechanics
1.1 Formula of status/vegetable/... gain. Probability of the buffs of big success cooking. ......   
1.2 Events at a fixed turn of scenario    
1.3 List of parameters    
#### 2.Scenario Simulator
Mainly Game.h/cpp
#### 3.Search,Handwritten-logic,....

I will be very glad if someone can help me do this. I have no experience with OCR.





## Manual-input version updated on 2024.6.3. See the release page.
introduction will be written later. 

This tool is just for **algorithm learning**. Don't use it for illegal purpose.   
You can compile this tool by yourself. Change the settings in config.h, then you can evaluate the cardset strength or have a simulation game with this program.    
You can also learn the game mechanisms(such as the formula of training status gain) from the source code (mainly Game.h/cpp)

Although it's just a "very advanced calculator" which can **never change** the status of the game. Many people think this is an **"illegal tool"(不正ツール)**.    
So I would **NOT** provide more information for the installation.    
Later I will publish a **"absolutely legal"** version, whose game status is inputed **manually** so it will need no modification to the game program itself.
